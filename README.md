A project aiming to make Air Penguin (1.0.5) fun and able to run on new Android versions!

## What is Air Penguin?
Air Penguin is a mobile game made in 2011 for Android and iOS devices, where you use the gyroscope sensors to control the penguin, it's a fun game.
## What is this project supposed to do?
Air Penguin 1.0.5 doesn't run on Android 10+ because of getDeviceId's restrictions, it also doesn't want to install at all.

This repository contains AndroidManifest and smali patches to make the app installable and working!

## Future goals besides making the game installable? Future mods? More patches?
For now this is it, I will later attempt to make the game moddable and an API to make levels.
